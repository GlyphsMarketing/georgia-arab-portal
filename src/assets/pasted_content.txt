I want you to build a responsive, luxury-style community portal for the Arab community in Georgia (USA). The website should be developed in Next.js (React) with smooth animations, transitions, and motion effects, fully SEO-optimized, and support multilingual functionality (English LTR and Arabic RTL). It must also include a functional dark/light mode switch.

The platform should include both public pages and a user account portal for managing listings, businesses, real estate, marketplace products, jobs, and support tickets. The design should be modern, luxurious, and responsive on desktop, tablet, and mobile. Performance should be optimized with lazy-loading, schema markup, and SEO best practices.
